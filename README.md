# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python and Turtle Graphics.

----------------------------------------------------

Currently a WIP. 

Feel free to help in any way! 

----------------------------------------------------

This script uses Python and Turtle to create a
  playing board for Tic-Tac-Toe.  It gets input
  from the User clicking on where they want to go. 
  
Three options will be available soon, User vs. User,
  User vs. PC, and PC vs. PC. User vs. User works,
  however the PC AI does not.
